Here we create a communication program in the form of a client and a server.

You must create a communication program in the form of a client and a server.
  • The server must be started first. After its launch, it has to print its PID.
  • The client takes two parameters:
       ◦ The server PID.
       ◦ The string to send.
  • The client must send the string passed as a parameter to the server. Once the string has been received, the server must print it.
  • The server has to display the string pretty quickly. Quickly means that if you think it takes too long, then it is probably too long.
  • Your server should be able to receive strings from several clients in a row without needing to restart.
  • The communication between your client and your server has to be done only using UNIX signals.
  • You can only use these two signals: SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.
  
  Bonus part
  • The server acknowledges every message received by sending back a signal to the client.
  • Unicode characters support!
